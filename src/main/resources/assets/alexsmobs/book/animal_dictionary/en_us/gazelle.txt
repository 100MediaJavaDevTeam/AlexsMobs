The Gazelle is a small mammal endemic to the savannas of the Overworld. A dainty creature, the Gazelle is quite timid, and
 can be observed foraging in large herds. When one gazelle is attacked, all members of their group will attempt to flee from
 danger, running extremely quickly from any perceived threat.
